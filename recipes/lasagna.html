    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Filling and easy to make, lasagnas are great one-dish meals that check all the boxes, as they can be filled with all sorts of veggies, sauces, and proteins, and can be adjusted to many special dietary needs.
        Red and white sauce lasagna is a flavorful combination of a basic white sauce, rather than ricotta cheese, and a tomato-based sauce with beef and pork that's flavored with spices and mushrooms.
        Covered in cheese and baked until golden, this is a great weeknight meal served with a simple salad and crusty bread.

    <p>
        I used oven-ready (also called no-boil) lasagna noodles to speed up the cooking time.
        Simply assemble the lasagna with the uncooked noodles, seal it tight with foil, and bake.
        As the sauce simmers, the noodles cook all on their own thanks in part to the moisture in the sauces.
        The key is to keep the lasagna covered in the oven until the noodles are soft.
        Removing the foil allows the upper layer of the lasagna to achieve an appetizing golden color.
        The oven-ready noodles are also available in a gluten-free version if someone in your household has special dietary needs.

        <li>Assemble the Lasagna</li>

                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 F. In a 3-quart ovenproof baking dish, ladle enough of the red sauce to cover the bottom of the baking dish.</li>

                <li>Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 40 minutes.</li>
                <li>After 40 minutes, remove foil and bake for about 10 more minutes, or until the cheese on top has browned slightly. Remove lasagna from oven and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
