    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Whipped hot cocoa isn't actually hot, but it is super delicious and rich - a perfect kid-friendly variation of the popular dalgona coffee. 
        Ice cold milk is topped with a freshly whipped chocolate cream and finished with a drizzle of chocolate syrup. 
        Stir it up or eat spoonfuls of the whipped chocolate while you sip the milk. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're not a fan of coffee, but you want to make a beautiful whipped drink, then this is the drink for you. 
        The whipped cocoa can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days, so double up the batch and have any easy, indulgent beverage waiting for you tomorrow, too.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>Chocolate syrup, or mini chocolate chips, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Beat together the cocoa powder, sugar, hot water, heavy whipping cream, and vanilla in a small bowl with the beaters of a hand mixer until super fluffy. Do not overbeat or the cream will start to separate. It will take less than a minute to whip together. Taste to check and see if the sugar is still grainy. If it is, beat a little longer.</li>
        <li>Add ice and the milk to a cold glass.</li>
        <li>Top the milk with the whipped chocolate.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with chocolate syrup and top with mini chocolate chips if you wish. Stir and serve immediately.</li>
